## Prompt
How do I change Windows Powershell Execution Policy so that it is not restricted?

## Response
To change the Windows PowerShell execution policy so that it is not restricted, you can follow these steps:

Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Windows PowerShell icon and selecting "Run as administrator".

Check the current execution policy by running the following command:

```Get-ExecutionPolicy```

This will display the current execution policy for PowerShell.

If the current execution policy is "Restricted", you can change it by running the following command:

```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted```

This will allow all scripts to run in PowerShell. If you prefer, you can use a more restrictive execution policy, such as "RemoteSigned" or "AllSigned".

PowerShell will prompt you to confirm that you want to change the execution policy. Type "Y" and press Enter to confirm.

After changing the execution policy, you can verify the new policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command again.

Note that changing the PowerShell execution policy can make your system more vulnerable to security risks. It is recommended that you only change the execution policy if you trust the source of the scripts you will be running, and that you reset the execution policy to its original value once you have finished running the scripts.
